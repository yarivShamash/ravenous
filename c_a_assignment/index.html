                </p>
                <p>These wise words of Rabbit Kekai who started surfing on the 1920's echoed in 
                     my mind since the first time I've heard them. <br>
                     My name is <span class="name">Yariv Shamash</span>, and  here I present the impact surfing had on my life and the events
                     that followed.

                    <p>I started surfing on the summer of the year 2000. I was 17 at that time and surfing was 
                        something I wanted to do ever since I was little.<br>
                        My parents got me a board from a neighbor of ours who was surfing for a long time and I hit the water, learned by 
                        practice, one wipeout after another. <br>          
                    <p>After my military service I started thinking what should I learn in Uni. I thought of many fields but one appealed 
                        to me the most. It was Marine Sciences, I was eager to understand what makes things work in the Oceans. What generates
                        waves? Which creatures live under the water? How does human activity impact them? And what can we do reduce it's negative effect
                        on these magnificent creatures. <br>
                        I finished my B. Sc. in Marine Sciences in 2010, and later went on and completed a Master’s Degree in the university of Tel Aviv. 
                        My research started as part of a project to generate Hydrogen through genetically modified algaes and shifted to the structural 
                        research of an amazing protein complex named Photosystem I which acts as a nearly perfect photovoltaic cell.

                    <p>After completing my Master’s degree I worked at a variety of jobs from a logistics manager at an Eco-Lodge in Tanzania, to a 
                        developer and logistics manager in an agricultural startup. Where we developed Hydroponic systems to be used by city sleekers that 
                        wanted to grow veggies with no pesticides.<br>
                        Nowadays I work as an after-school activities science teacher for kids and also as a surf instructor focusing on teaching adults how 
                        to surf and be more ocean-conscious.<br>
                        Most of the jobs I did were not financially rewarding enough to support life in israel, a relatively expensive place.<br>
                        And therefore, I set myself on a new course, web-application development. I started a basic online course with Codecademy and I 
                        realized it was appealing to me and that sitting for hours in front of a computer, tackling new material and solving the challenges 
                        it brings with it.
